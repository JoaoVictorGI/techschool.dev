      # Step: Conditionally bust the cache when job is re-run.
      # Sometimes, we may have issues with incremental builds that are fixed by
      # doing a full recompile. In order to not waste dev time on such trivial
      # issues (while also reaping the time savings of incremental builds for
      # *most* day-to-day development), force a full recompile only on builds
      # that are retried.
